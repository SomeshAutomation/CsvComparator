# CSV File  Comparator Assessment

* This framework is based on Cucumber - Java using apache.commons-csv library.
* For reporting Allure Library is used. Lombak library is used for logging and other Data annotation.


------------------------------------------------------------
## Libraries and Framework Used

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management and life cycle
* [Java 11] - Programming Language
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) - Framework ( Increase readability)
* [Allure Reports](https://qameta.io/allure-report/) - Reporting
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Provides Annotation to save space and time , also logging

------------------------------------------------------------
## Prerequisites

* Java 11 and Maven Installed, path set in environmental variables
* Allure configured
  (Please refer https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline)
------------------------------------------------------------

## CSV Comparison Logic Explained
This test case implements logic to compare two CSV files and identify differences at both the row and column level. The following steps outline the process:

**CSV File Loading**
* Both CSV files are read and parsed into CSVRecord lists using the apache.commons-csv library.

**Row-wise & Column-wise Comparison**
* Each corresponding row from both files is compared value-by-value (column-by-column). Differences in any column values are detected and reported.

**Column Count Validation**
* If any row in either file contains more or fewer columns than its counterpart, this inconsistency is identified and asserted during the comparison.

**Row Count Validation**
* If one file has additional or missing rows compared to the other, those discrepancies (extra or missing records) are captured and added as attachments to the Allure report for further analysis.

## Running Project

Once the details are update in config.properties file

Run below command
```
mvn clean test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@CsvComparison"
```
------------------------------------------------------------
## Reports

## Allure Report**

### Option 1
open target/allure-reports/index.html file
( if allure report is not generated by framework then go for option 2)

### Option 2
* in project path, please navigate to target folder
```
 cd target/
```
* then Run below command
```
allure serve
```
